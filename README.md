# LMS Microservices

## Clean Architecture with Spring Boot 4

## Overview

This codebase is designed for Java backend developers interested in a **Microservices** application
following on **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID** principles, built with **Spring Boot 4**, **Java
25**, and **Spring Framework 7**.

## Clean Architecture Implementation Layers

Services in this app implement strict architectural boundaries enforced by ArchUnit rules that
cause failing unit tests when violated.
In each service, there are 3 layers:

### Domain

- contains only business logic, entities, command/queries.
- Persistence(JDBC, JPA, NoSQL) or Spring code is not allowed in this layer.
- This is the innermost layer; it shouldn't know anything about the other layers.
- Any access or references to classes in the other 2 layers will cause unit test failure.

### Storage

- Contains only classes related to data persistence, JPA, JDBC, or any other data storing mechanism
  that belong to this layer.
- Only calls to persistence classes are allowed.
- Spring configs and web classes don't belong here.
- This is the second inner layer; it can access the Domain layer.
- Any access or references to classes in the Application layer will cause unit test failure.

### Application

- Spring beans, web classes live here.
- It can access both previous layers since this is the most outward layer.

---

## Notable Features

### Automatic Audit Logs Recording

Use Spring **AOP** to create Audit Events automatically whenever any API in any of the services is
called and saved to persistence, allowing the controllers to be clutter-free.

### Clean Restful API in all services

The API follows the modern best practices in RESTful services recommendations,
like using **ResponseEntity** and returning **ProblemDetail**.

### CQRS

Command and Query Separation Principle to implement Business logic.

### Rate Limiting

Implemented in **API Gateway** using **Redis Rate Limiter**.

### Outbox Pattern

Implements the Outbox Pattern for sending audit events to guarantee 100% message delivery.

### ArchUnit

Validate architectural boundaries and verify adherence to best coding standards.

### PMD and Pitest

Use PMD to verify the coding style and Pitest for mutation testing.

### RestControllerAdvice

Handle specific exceptions and return a unified and standard error response instead of an exception
stack trace using Spring **ProblemDetail**.
Example of API response for every error.

```
{
    "type": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/RuntimeException.html",
    "title": "Requested Student Not Found",
    "status": 404,
    "detail": "Student by the requested id not found",
    "instance": "/students/protected/v1/accounts/33bff7c7-77ee-4c51-9ee0-c870b437f82e",
    "category": "Resource Not Found",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-22T18:45:43.927431130Z"
}
```

### OpenAPI and Swagger Docs

Provides detailed documentation for all endpoints.

### Entity and DTO separation

Decouples core business logic from presentation using request and response POJO.

### Domain Entity and JPA separation

Domain entities have no association with JPA and are never annotated with @Entity.

## Sample audit log from Audit-Service captured from API calls in Student-Service

```
        // Create Student Endpoint
        {
            "id": "6797e0215829937787277607",
            "serviceName": "student-service",
            "location": "/students/protected/v1/accounts",
            "action": "Create",
            "data": "CreateStudentRequest(firstName=Hayden, lastName=Ondricka, email=Helen21@gmail.com, dateOfBirth=977659882000, gender=MALE, address=Bernhard Cape)",
            "creationDate": "2025-01-27T14:36:01.528",
            "duration": "50ms",
            "response": "CreateStudentResponse(id=9622e5ef-5ab7-4faf-89db-7dd970ea8ef0)"
        }

        // Delete Student Endpoint
        {
            "id": "6797e0115829937787277605",
            "serviceName": "student-service",
            "location": "/students/protected/v1/accounts/{id}",
            "action": "Delete",
            "data": "e8cd23d1-4bad-44bb-9b58-a3ca89dbf793",
            "creationDate": "2025-01-27T14:35:45.631",
            "duration": "25ms",
            "response": "Void"
        },
        
        // Read Student by ID Endpoint
        {
            "id": "6797e0145829937787277606",
            "serviceName": "student-service",
            "location": "/students/protected/v1/accounts/{id}",
            "action": "Read",
            "data": "e8cd23d1-4bad-44bb-9b58-a3ca89dbf793",
            "creationDate": "2025-01-27T14:35:48.66",
            "duration": "14ms",
            "response": "Error: Student by the requested id not found"
        }
```

### Currently, the following services are implemented; other services will be added:

- Discovery Server
- API Gateway
- Student Service
- Audit Service
