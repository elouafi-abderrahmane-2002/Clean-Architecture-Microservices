# Test Naming Convention

### This project follows the Clean Code Manual for naming convention for unit and integration test methods.

## Purpose

To improve test readability, maintain consistency, and make it easier to understand what each test
is verifying at a glance.

## Format

```
should{ExpectedBehavior}
```

- `should`: A constant keyword indicating expected behavior.
- `ExpectedBehavior`: The specific outcome or behavior expected.

## Examples

| Method Under Test | Test Method Name               | Description                                     |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `findAll`         | `shouldReturnAllEvents`        | Verifies that `findAll()` returns all events.   |
| `save`            | `shouldSaveEventToStorage`     | Verifies that `save()` stores the event.        |
| `deleteById`      | `shouldRemoveEventFromStorage` | Verifies that deletion by ID works as expected. |
| `calculateTotal`  | `shouldReturnCorrectSum`       | Verifies correct calculation logic.             |

## Notes

- Use meaningful, concise names for the method and expected behavior.
- Avoid including low-level details unless relevant to the test.
- Apply consistently across all test types (unit, integration, etc.).
